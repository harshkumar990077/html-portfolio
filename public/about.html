<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, I'm Harsh Kumar. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at DCRUST, Sonipat. My journey into the world of web development started with a curiosity to understand how websites work, and it has since become a passion.</p>

  <p>When I'm not coding, you might find me at the local swimming pool, where I've been enjoying the water since childhood. It's not just a sport for me; it's a way to unwind and stay fit.</p>
  
  <p> In my free time, I also enjoy painting. It's a creative outlet that allows me to express myself and escape into a world of colors and imagination.</p>
  
  <p> I'm an avid reader, particularly when it comes to self-development books. I believe in the power of continuous learning and personal growth.</p>
  
  <p> Lastly, I've found solace in meditation. It helps me stay grounded and maintain a sense of calm in our fast-paced world.</p>
  
  <p>I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in the field of web development and look forward to connecting with others who share a similar passion.</p>
